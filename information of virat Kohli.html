Virat Kohli played a significant role in India’s victorious campaign during the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, held in the USA and West Indies. Although Kohli faced criticism for inconsistent performances in earlier matches, his defining moment came in the final against South Africa. He scored a crucial 76 runs off 59 balls, rescuing India from an early collapse when the team was struggling at 34/3. Kohli's innings, marked by six fours and two sixes, laid the foundation for India's competitive total of 176 runs.
Throughout the tournament, Kohli's batting strategy evolved based on team requirements. He started as an aggressive opener in earlier games but shifted to playing a stabilizing role in critical matches. Despite some low scores in group stages, his experience and resilience shone through in the high-pressure final.
This victory not only marked Kohli’s first T20 World Cup title but also India’s first ICC trophy in 13 years, breaking a long drought. Kohli's emotional celebration after the win reflected his immense pride and relief at achieving this milestone. His performance reaffirmed his status as a master of high-pressure games, contributing significantly to India’s success.
